                        Algae can be utilized as a part of the mitigation strategy to reduce concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere associated with greenhouse gases and the global climate crisis. Here we discuss what makes algae so special, the global climate crisis, and the part algae can play in helping to combat the effects of global warming.
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">So why are algae so special?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Algae are photosynthetic organisms with plat-like characteristics 
mainly found in aquatic environments. They are classified Protista and 
sometimes Plantae, though this latter designation draws controversy. But
 whatever the taxonomical rank assigned, there is no doubting the 
enormous significance of these tremendously productive organisms.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        There are seven types of algae, categorized based on pigmentation 
type and food reserves: green algae (Chlorophyta), euglenoids 
(Euglenophyta), golden-brown algae and diatoms (Chrysophyta), fire 
algae (Pyrrophyta), red algae (Rhodophyta), yellow-green algae 
(Xanthophyta), and brown algae (Paeophyta).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Algae produce a vast quantity (thought to be about half) of the 
oxygen in the oceans, rivers, and lakes of the world. This feat is 
miraculously achieved at only roughly 1/10th of the biomass of the entire plant population on Earth. Algae need nitrogen, phosphate, water, CO2 and sunlight for efficient growth.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        The main composition of algae comprises carbohydrates, lipids, 
proteins, carotenoids such as lutein, astaxanthin and fucoxanthin, and 
nucleic acids. The specific composition is dependent on algal strain and
 can also be influenced by method of cultivation. Algae possess notable 
capacities for photosynthesis and thus CO2 sequestration, excessive biomass production, high lipid accumulation and the production of valuable non-fuel co-products.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        That algae sequester carbon for growth makes these organisms an 
invaluable asset in the mitigation of greenhouse gases and climate 
change and their integral role in our world's oceanic and coastal 
ecosystems means they are an important blue carbon sink. Research has 
also demonstrated the superior capacity of algae to produce bioenergy, 
biofuels, and biomaterials from terrestrial biomass ––most of this a 
by-product of agricultural or biodegradable waste.

                    <p>
                        Climate change refers to shifts in average temperature and weather 
patterns over time that occurs because of an increase in greenhouse 
gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. GHG emissions alongside 
industrialization, ocean acidification, soil erosion and deforestation 
are all implicated in the process of climate change. The concomitant 
increase in CO2 levels accounts for more than half of the warming potential.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        A solution for the mitigation and reduction of carbon dioxide concentration in atmospheric air is CO2 capture and storage technology. These are divided into physical and biological 
––the so-called green technologies. On the biological side, 
photosynthesis involving the sequestration of CO2 carried 
out by plants and algae is by far the most environmentally friendly and 
sustainable solution. This process is fostered through improvements made
 to natural sinks like forestation, ocean fertilization, and microalgae 
cultivation.
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        The Paris Agreement was a 2015 treaty on climate change that called 
for the removal of carbon from the atmosphere and the lowering of 
emissions. Since then, the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) has advocated for cutting carbon levels in order
 to limit global warming. It aims for less than a 2°C temperature rise 
above pre-industrial levels.

                    <p>
                        A disproportionate amount of carbon sequestration is contributed by 
coastal vegetated ecosystems and the international community has agreed 
on a blue carbon initiative. The sequestration of CO2 by microalgae could be one of the most efficient and economical of the technological options available.

                    <p>
                        Seaweed is a blue carbon sink. This macroalgae sequesters blue carbon
 and thus represents a climate change solution, although this 
realization has only been recently made. Not only this but it offers the
 potential for reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and for 
regenerative ocean farming with positive implications for future food 
security.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Blue carbon is organic carbon captured and stored by ocean and coastal ecosystems. Seaweed ecosystems sequester CO2 and contribute to the bioremediation of coastal pollutants and the habitat of other marine organisms.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        However, the role of seaweed in blue carbon strategy has been 
controversial, particularly as, up until recently, researchers believed 
that seaweed decomposed in the ocean and played no role in the capture 
of carbon.

                    <p>
                        Now that it is understood that macroalgae do play an important role 
in carbon capture, we need to scale up the surface area covered by 
macroalgal-dominated systems and thus the level of sequestration 
potential on a global scale.

                    <p>
                        Algae are an attractive source of sustainable energy. Microalgae strains most efficient in CO2 bioconversion for biomass production include Scenedesmus obliquus, Botryococcus braunii, Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis oculate. Chlorella sp. has also been demonstrated to possess high biomass production (up to 1.06 g L/d).

                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        The ideal species should possess a high sinking capacity and tolerance to various conditions such as CO2 concentration, toxic pollutant levels, temperature, nutrient limitations, and pH effect.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        The two types of cultivation systems for algae are open pond (OP) and
 photobioreactor (PBR). OP is used most frequently in commercial 
microalgae cultivation. Green photosynthetic algae boast high growth 
rates and minimal spatial requirements (comparative to plants).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, algal potential in the production of biofuel remains 
technologically limited at present. It would take a pool three times the
 size of Belgium to approach just 10% of EU transport fuels.
