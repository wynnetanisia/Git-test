                        If the experts are correct then solar energy would become mainstream in the near future.
 Even right now it is the most popular form of renewable energy. 
However, keeping in mind all its advantages and disadvantages, it is 
necessary that we make use of it in as many varied ways as possible. 
Even conventional photovoltaic solar panels have several types. One of them is Transparent Solar Panels. Nevertheless, it too has its pros and cons.

                    <h2>The good, the bad and the ugly about Transparent solar panels</h2>
                    <p>
                        Transparent solar panels are the most flexible, portable and 
convenient solar panels on the market now. With the advancement in solar
 technology, flexible solar panels can now produce more energy than 
conventional solar panels. You can find various types of transparent 
solar panels based on their capacity, transparency rates, and many other
 factors. It is the way you can produce solar energy in the most 
convenient method these days. Transparent solar panels are film-like 
thin and you can use them anywhere on window panes unlike the 
traditional solar panels, which are heavier and need to be implemented 
either on rooftop or in an open space. Here we analyze everything about 
the effectiveness of transparent solar panels.

                    <p>
                        Since transparent solar panels can produce more power, you need to earmark some money for such panels. You can certainly retain the money through its usage to produce power to propel fans, bulbs and other devices. Well, transparent solar panels are basically meant to ward off the complexity in the usage of traditional solar panels. There is no chore involved in establishing portable solar cells either in your office or home.

                        Once established, these solar panels can bring you alternative power in rather better amount than its traditional counterparts. Moreover, transparent solar panels are lightweight and portable, meaning that you can carry them from one place to the other with less effort. As a whole, using transparent solar cells, you can produce more alternative power, which can lead to the less burning of the depleting and polluting coal for energy.

                    <h3>can this be better</h3>
                    <p>
                        The advancement in solar energy technology can bring in a real revolution in alternative power generation. Ideas like flexible and paint-able solar cells are to make the industry a bit more energetic.
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>the bad</h3>
                    <p>
                        The biggest disadvantage of transparent solar panels is that they can only produce less amount of power. You will have to buy a large set of solar cells to power up entire your house. Moreover, you won’t be able to power up the already existing electronic accessories of your house with the transparent cells. Solar companies often provide special sets of bulbs and fans to operate with the translucent solar cells. It means you will have to pay extra for the packed-in accessories.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        One other key drawback is that the when the sky is filled with clouds, translucent solar panels won’t be able to produce enough power. Even the accessories you bought along with the cells may not work. It will put you in dark if you have already disconnected regular electricity line trusting in the solar panels. And, another thing is that translucent solar panels are made of glass, meaning that intense care is needed while handling them. Otherwise, the panels will break.

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>can this be avoided?</h3>
                    <p>
                        To confront with the issue of high price, governments across the world should take initiatives to sponsor more solar-based technologies. For the issue of the lack of sunlight, there should be far more developments in the very technology of solar panels, thus to make them more effective in grabbing sunlight and heat to produce power.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>the ugly</h3>
                    <p>
                        The set-up cost of translucent solar cells is high. As you have to buy separate bulbs and fans to run with the solar cells, you have to pay extra for both. Further, you should also buy a back-up system including powerful batteries and adapters to store the power generated by the solar cells. In short, you will have to spend a large amount to get all these things and make your dreams of alternative power functional in your household. Sun and its heat are the source for solar cells to generate power. If the sun is hiding behind clouds a day, you will be in dark in the night, because sufficient power would not have produced and stored.

                <div class="section">
                    <h3>why are we so critical?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is very important that we should have far more effective solar panels for the production of alternative energy. There should be technologies for the consistent generation of solar power.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is high time the world should switch over to the alternative power
 options. What will happen otherwise is that the world will plunge into 
deep energy crisis, which has been threatening humans for a while. 
Indeed, solar energy is one of the best dependable means to generate 
alternative energy notwithstanding many of its drawbacks. Translucent 
solar panels make the task of solar energy generation further an easy 
job. You can handle transparent solar panels simply to produce energy to
 light up your house. However, there are some serious drawbacks in 
completely depending upon these flexible solar cells to fabricate the 
entire energy for your household.
