                    <p>
                        If you're concerned about the life of your Tesla battery, fret not: the company has automobiles that last for 300 to 400 miles. Tesla is at the front of the electric car revolution because their models offer some of the industry's finest battery ranges. Read on to know about how ranges fluctuate across Tesla models, why various vehicles have varied ranges and how long do Tesla batteries last.

                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        On a single charge, the batteries in Tesla vehicles can power the vehicles for an average of 336 miles. The Tesla Model 3 has a range of just 267 miles, whereas the Model S has a range of 405 miles, making the Model 3 the model with the shortest range.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        It is possible that the Model 3 will need to be charged once every few days if it is used for daily commuting, but otherwise it will operate admirably. Both variants of the Model S have a substantial driving range, allowing drivers of longer distances to reach their destinations without having to make an excessive number of stops at Superchargers.

                    <h2 class="sub-heading">Why Do Battery Ranges Vary By Model?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Looking at how long the batteries in 
                        each Tesla are expected to last, you may be wondering why the ranges of 
                        Tesla's various vehicles are so different from one another. Tesla's 
                        vehicle models, much like those produced by traditional manufacturers of
                        gas-powered automobiles, each have characteristics that set them apart 
                        from one another and, as a result, influence the amount of time their 
                        batteries can maintain their charge. The most essential factors in 
                        establishing the exact range of an electric vehicle are the size of its 
                        battery and the type of the vehicle.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">Battery size</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a rule of thumb, the larger the 
battery, the greater the amount of energy that can be stored and, as a 
result, the greater the range. For instance, the battery capacity of the
 Tesla Model S is 98 kilowatt-hours (kWh), but the battery capacity of 
the Tesla Model 3 is 80.5 kWh. This makes perfect sense, considering 
that the Model S has a range that is far greater than that of the Model 
3.

                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">Tesla model</h2>
                    <p>
                        Electric automobiles that are able to 
make more effective use of the energy they have stored will be able to 
get more mileage. A number of factors, including aerodynamics, the 
amount of friction that occurs between the tires and the road, the 
efficiency of the powertrain, and the weight of the vehicle, all 
contribute. A Tesla model with drivetrain technology (which is often 
found in newer models) and a low weight will utilize the stored power 
more effectively than a model having an older drivetrain that is less 
efficient and a frame that is more cumbersome.

                    <h2 class="sub-heading">How long do Tesla batteries last?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Elon Musk has said on his Twitter 
                        account that the batteries in Tesla vehicles are designed to 
                        theoretically survive for 300,000 - 500,000 miles,
                         that is equivalent to 1,500 battery cycles. According to the Department
                         of Transportation, it amounts to around 22 to 37 years for an average 
                        automobile driver, and a total of 13,500 miles per year.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading"></h2>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that this 
                        isn't the same distance as the warranties offered by Tesla. Once 
                        100,000-150,000 miles (depending on the model), Tesla will no longer 
                        cover the cost of repairs or replacements for your battery if it has 
                        degraded beyond a certain point. The company cannot guarantee how well 
                        your battery will function after it has been driven that far.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading"></h2>
                    <p>
                        If you drive a Tesla vehicle 300,000 -
                        500,000 miles on a single battery, you will probably be dealing with a 
                       battery that is quite worn out. The cost of changing the battery in your
                        Tesla might be difficult to estimate, but you don't have to wait until 
                       you've racked up a certain amount of miles before doing so. Musk states 
                       that it may cost between $5,000 & $7,000 to replace a single module 
                       in the same tweet that was stated above. However, you should bear in 
                       mind that the Tesla battery pack has numerous modules, so it would not 
                       be cost efficient to replace your whole battery.

                        We hope by the end of this article you
                        have got a fair idea of how long do Tesla batteries last and the 
                        different factors that play an imperative role in the life of your Tesla battery. It
                        will be wise for you to know beforehand about the battery life for each
                        Tesla car and the battery replacement cost before you make any 
                       purchase.
