                        We all need to change our habits and our consumption patterns in order to 
reach the climate goals. There is much you can do right away to reduce 
your impact on the climate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The average carbon footprint per person and year in Sweden is 10 tonnes, 
which is significantly higher than the global average. For the world to 
keep the global temperature increase well below two degrees, the 
emissions of greenhouse gases need to come down as far below 2 tonnes 
per person as possible by 2050.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        What we do as individuals is an important factor in reducing the global greenhouse emissions.
                    </p>

                        All the choices we make matter and can contribute to reducing our 
emissions. If you feel that your choices do not make enough of a 
difference and that they seem unimportant – think again! Your actions 
may encourage others to make more climate-smart choices. Travelling less
 by air, changing our eating habits and buying second-hand instead of 
new, creates great climate gains, and it can reduce your carbon 
footprint by several tonnes per year.

                        The last 2–3 tonnes of emissions per person are difficult to change yourself, as they relate to
 the construction of infrastructure and public sector consumption, for 
example.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        The responsibility for reducing emissions does not lie 
solely with the consumer, but must also be shared by the public sector 
and industry.

                    <h3>Our travel habits make the greatest climate impact</h3>
                    <p>
                        For many people, air travel is the largest source of emissions. Travelling 
less frequently and staying longer when you do go away is one way of 
reducing your carbon footprint.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        You can see your carbon footprint 
on your flight ticket, or use the ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator to 
calculate your emissions. Note that these calculations do not include 
the effect of flying at high altitude, which means that your emissions 
are probably around twice as high for longer flights. The reason for 
this is that high-altitude emissions create contrails (condensation 
trails) and nitrogen oxide emissions, which also have a warming effect 
on the climate.
                    </p>

                        Taking
 the train or public transport is always better than taking a car that 
runs on fossil fuel. If you have to travel by car, it is better to 
carpool and to choose an eco-friendly vehicle. A medium-sized car 
releases close to 2 kg of greenhouse gases each 10 km. If a family 
travels around 20,000 km per year, this would equal 4 tonnes per year.

                    <h3>What we eat makes a great difference to the climate</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cutting down on our consumption of certain foods, such as red meat, is of great
 significance to reducing our emissions. Today, the consumption of meat 
alone gives rise to just under one tonne of emissions per person and 
year on average in Sweden.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Average climate impact of different food products</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sweden's National Food Agency recommends us not to eat more than 500 grams of 
red meat per person and week for health reasons; but today we are 
averaging around 600 grams. The amount of meat you can eat in an average
 week to achieve a total carbon footprint under two tonnes depends on 
how much you travel and consume in general.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        The simple answer is 
that we need to eat less red meat and cheese. Reducing the consumption 
of red meat is an effective measure to reduce our climate impact, and it
 is especially important, as it is possible to reduce the emissions from
 its production. Exactly what amount is sustainable in order to reach 
the climate goals is hard to say, as this depends on how much is 
released otherwise.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Even if the meat consumption needs to be 
reduced for the sake of the climate, grazing animals also have a 
positive effect on the environment, for example through increased 
biodiversity.

                    <p>
                        Choosing a smaller home and switching to climate-smart heating can make a great 
difference, depending on your current living situation.

                    <p>
                        You can also make an impact by making your home more energy-efficient. Insulate windows and doors to reduce the heating need.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        You can reduce your energy consumption by lowering the indoor temperature 
somewhat. Use hot water sparingly and use a dishwasher instead of 
running water. Wash your clothes at lower temperatures and hang your 
laundry to dry rather than using a tumble dryer. Keep your appliances at
 the right temperature: minus 18 degrees in the freezer and plus 5 
degrees in the refrigerator.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        If you need new furniture, appliances
 and electronics, remember that reuse and second-hand is always better 
than buying new. Repair instead of buying new major appliances, and 
change your old appliances for more energy-efficient ones when the time 
comes.

                        The way your electricity has been produced also affects the climate. You 
can opt to buy eco-labelled electricity from renewable sources, or 
perhaps invest in your own production of renewable electricity by 
installing solar cells on the roof.

                    <h3>Carbon offsetting is the last resort</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is always better not to cause the emissions in the first place if you 
wish to reduce your carbon footprint. But if that is not possible, you 
can use carbon offsetting. Carbon offsetting means that you pay for the 
reduction of a certain amount of emissions elsewhere, or that the 
corresponding emissions are taken up in nature. This allows you to 
compensate for the emissions, for example from a journey by air or for 
your whole lifestyle. Or why not give it to someone else as a present!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        There are different ways to carbon offset. The most common way is to purchase
 reductions created through carbon offsetting projects, often in 
developing countries. Typical projects include energy initiatives that 
replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, for example by changing to 
cleaner stoves or by installing solar panels. Other projects may relate 
to increasing the uptake and storage of carbon dioxide, for example by 
planting trees.
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        In order to ensure that the reduction in emissions
 is real, the projects should be certified according to one of the 
developed standards. The Gold Standard is a good example of a 
certification that has been developed by environmental organisations and
 which has high-set requirement on both verified emission reductions and
 sustainable development.

                    <h3>Our savings are important in the climate shift</h3>
                    <p>
                        How you save your money also impacts on the climate. To a large extent, our savings currently do not contribute to the shift that is necessary to 
reach the climate goals. Whether you have money in a savings account, in
 unit trusts or in shares of a company, your money can be used to 
benefit the climate. It may be a good idea to review your investments 
and choose unit trusts, shares or a bank with a good climate profile. 
You can actively strive to influence the actions of your unit trusts, 
the companies you invest in and your bank.
